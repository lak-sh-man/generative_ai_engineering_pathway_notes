# üî• Classic Spark vs Spark Connect

## Classic Spark (aka In-Process Spark Session)
- `Architecture`: Your code runs inside the Spark driver process on the cluster.
- `API Access`: Full access to Spark internals‚Äîspark.conf.set(...), SparkContext, dbutils, pandas_udf, Arrow optimization, MLlib, RDDs.
- `Use Case`: Ideal for ETL, machine learning, and production workloads, or when you need to tune configs or access low-level Spark features.
- `Within Databricks`: Requires a classic (interactive) cluster, not a SQL Warehouse or Spark Connect-enabled cluster.

## Spark Connect (client‚Äìserver model)
- `Architecture`: Your Python code acts as a remote client, sending logical plans via gRPC to the Spark driver/server, which executes them.
    - The client does not run inside the driver (no Py4J). 

- `Limitations`:
    - Cannot run spark.conf.set(...), as settings are driver-side only.
    - No access to SparkContext or internals (RDDs).
    - Some UDFs, dbutils, and streaming/wide transforms are not supported.

- `Benefits`:
    - Lightweight client, no JVM on client machine. 
    - Multi-tenant use: Shared Spark server can serve many clients efficiently. 
    - Easier to integrate with IDEs (like VS Code, Jupyter), remote debugging. 


## üîÑ Compatibility and Evolution
- Spark 4.0 has significantly closed the feature gap, bringing Spark Connect closer to Classic Spark in functionality and API parity. 
    - However, driver-scoped configuration (like spark.conf.set(...)) remains unsupported in Connect.


| Feature                   |   Classic Spark   |     Spark Connect     |
| ------------------------- | :---------------: | :-------------------: |
| `spark.conf.set(...)`     |      ‚úÖ Works      |        ‚ùå Fails        |
| Arrow / `toPandas()`      | ‚úÖ Fully supported |       ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited      |
| `pandas_udf`, MLlib, RDDs |       ‚úÖ Yes       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial/no support |
| Ideal for dev, ETL, ML    |       ‚úÖ Yes       |       ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited      |
| Lightweight IDE usage     |      ‚ö†Ô∏è Heavy     |      ‚úÖ Efficient      |


## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- Use Classic Spark for full control, advanced configurations, and heavy workloads.
- Use Spark Connect for lightweight development, remote debugging, and shared multi-user environments‚Äîbut know its limitations.
